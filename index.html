                <p>Old Trafford, also known as the Theater of Dreams, is home to Manchester United.
                    They are a soccer team that plays in the English Premier League that has

                <h2>Star Wars</h2>
                <img src="Images/image3.jpg" alt="Darth Vader" style="width: 75px;">
                <p>Darth Vader, who was Anakin Skywalker before his fall to the Darkside,
                    was presumed to be the villain during episodes IV and V of the original
                    trilogy. After an internal conflict of saving his son, he perished into 
                    the force and continued to look over Luke Skywalker in his journey of 
                    a Jedi Knight.</p>

                <img src="Images/image4.jpg" alt="Shinuya, Tokyo" style="width: 90px;">
                <p>
                    Shibuya, Tokyo has always been on my bucket list to visit since 
                    I saw Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift. During my first deployment we
                    ported in Japan, but unfortunately due to COVID-19 we were restricted
                    the base. Luckily, my wife and I were able to take a vacation and explore 
                    Japan for one week.
